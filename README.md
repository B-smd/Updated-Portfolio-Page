# Updated-Portfolio-Page

## Description
This Portfolio, I have made an updated a lot of things. I display all my works, Password Generator, Code Quiz, Day Planner, Weather Dashboard, BCKS project and my graphic designs. I am using Bootstrap 4 to create my Portfolio Page. For the first page all the codes in index.html and for the second page all the codes in design.html. For the responsiveness in CSS I make the image fully responsive. In the header I create class: jumbotron fluid, background- secondary, d-flex and justify-content-around. I put the card and my cartoon image inside the header. I turn my image into a card background and use .card-img-overlay to add text on top of the image. In navbar, I created three link, Designs, BCKS and BCKS project. I use Bootstrap 4 carousel to create a slideshow for cycling through elements to display my three graphic designs. About me section, I added my background as an architect with the link can go through website of the University "ITS", and I am studying Coding with the link can go through website Coding Bootcamp "UWA". I use a Bootstrap 4 Grid .row .col-12 for About Me, for the four image .row .col-8, col-4, col-4, col-8. For the bottom I made .container fluid navbar navbar-expand-sm bg-secondary justify-content-center class: row col-sm-3. I use icon from React icons. Similarly in design.html I use a Bootstrap 4 Grid.
